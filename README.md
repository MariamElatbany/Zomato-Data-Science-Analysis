# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis 🍴

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Zomato dataset to make it ready for analysis and machine learning.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found here: [Zomato Bangalore Restaurants (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants)

## 🚀 Project Status: Phase 1 (Data Cleaning)
I have successfully completed the Data Preprocessing stage, which includes:
- Dropping irrelevant columns like `url`, `phone`, and `address`.
- Handling missing values and removing duplicates.
